# Automated-Windows-Artifacts-Extractor-CLI
Windows Artifact Extractor automates the extraction of key Windows forensic artifacts (e.g., Prefetch, Jumplists, LNK, MFT, Registry) from disk images, ZIPs, or folders using tools like PECmd, JLECmd, LECmd, MFTECmd, and SBECmd. Outputs are saved as structured CSV/Excel reports.
